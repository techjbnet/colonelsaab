            Colonel Saab is an authentic and unique, luxury indian dining
            concept, in the centre of London, from award-winning entrepreneur
            Roop Partap Choudhary; your host, who meticulously crafted the menu
            and this art-festooned destination as a "love letter” to his family
            and India.
          </p>
          <p>
            Set in Holborn, this award winning restaurant is only a stone's
            throw away from London’s famous New Year Fireworks display. After
            the past 2 years of cancellations, this time around the displays
            will be highly anticipated. The event is scheduled to take place as
            normal for New Year's Eve 2022. Hear Big Ben's famous "bongs" ring
            out at midnight, followed by the UK's largest annual fireworks event
            presented by the Mayor of London.

            Restaurant Covent Garden New Year's Menus
          </h3>
          <p>
            Guests will dine in our extraordinary setting, described as a feast
            for the eyes, with a treasure trove of eclectic Indian art and
            artefacts collected by Mr Choudhary's family on their travels. The
            experience wouldn’t be complete without the 5-star service brought
            to you by Colonel Saab's staff. They play an indispensable part in
            the evening's proceedings by bringing the decadent surroundings to
            life and happily regaling guests with the rich stories and histories
            of the sumptuous artwork adorning the restaurant.
          </p>
          <p>
            Guests will be greeted by a live jazz band to set the mood and can
            select from our wonderful New Year’s Eve set menu, created for one
            night only, featuring some of the restaurant's most popular dishes
            mixed with special creations for the evening. We must not forget to
            mention our unique cocktail menu, crafted by the well known
            mixologist Anthony Bertin.
          </p>
          <p>
            The restaurant has private dining rooms always available for
            booking. These provide a more intimate setting and can accommodate
            up to 60 people for a reception or 30 for a sit down dinner. Guests
            can also dine in or hire the mezzanine area, a space reminiscent of
            quarters from a Royal Mahal. For a combination of classic elegance
            with exotic art, the mezzanine is a perfect place for a private
            event within the aura of the main restaurant, which it overlooks,
            and provides a great area for an intimate gathering of up to 40
            people.
          </p>
          <p>
            Colonel Saab eschews the artifice of contrived indian kitsch and
            instead presents an eclectic décor with consummate elegance and wit.
          </p>
          <p>
            Experience your unforgettable evening with us as we pop the
            champagne corks and cheer our way into the New Year at Colonel Saab.
            Reservations are essential!
