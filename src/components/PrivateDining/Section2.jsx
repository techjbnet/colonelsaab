                Colonel Saab is situated in the Grade II listed Holborn Town
                Hall building, which first opened as a public library in 1894.
                Today, apart from a few original features the new exotic design
                and decor of the restaurant compliments the old building with
                warm colours, brass and wood features and a stunning collection
                of chandeliers which have been handcrafted and shipped over from
                India.
                <br />
                In addition to the restaurant and bar, we have two tastefully
                designed private dining rooms which accommodate up to 60 people
                standing or 30 for a seated dinner, creating the ideal setting
                for any corporate dining or celebratory event.
