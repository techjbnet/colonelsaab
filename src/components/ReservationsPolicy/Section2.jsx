      card details on their system. Those details are temporarily held on their
      database. Once the booking has taken place the data is removed from the
      system. This is in Accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998.

      Can guests visit our restaurants without making a reservation?
      <br />
      We can be extremely busy, especially at weekends, during bank holidays and
      special events, but we do our best to accommodate our guests on a first
      come, first served basis. Sadly, some guests may be disappointed by the
      wait and we apologise for that but cannot guarantee a table at busy times.
      We therefore request for advance reservation.
