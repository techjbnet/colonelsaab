    <p>Colonel Saab is an award winning restaurant dedicated to founder Roop Partap Choudhary’s father. Recently listed by Forbes magazine as one of London’s best Indian restaurants, this meticulously crafted and art- festooned destination was created as a "love letter” to his father (Colonel Saab) and family, as well as to India.</p>
    <h3 class='text-success'>Father's Day Menu Covent Garden</h3>
    <p>Innovative hotelier, Choudhary, is passionate about delivering the true tastes of India he enjoyed on childhood adventures around the country with his parents. The extensive menu is inspired by the places Colonel Saab was stationed at and Choudhary spent a year retracing his father’s footsteps across India by train, bus and car.</p>
    <p>Choudhary explains: "My father’s decorated military career led to postings across India, tasting an array of delicious and varied regional food, from traditional local lunches in the tents of Rajasthan to British- inspired Indian breakfasts in the Officer’s Mess and stunning banquets hosted by Indian nobility and Maharajas. Travelling with them as a child taught me so much about different ways of life in India and the powerful role food plays. I wanted to celebrate these diverse cultures and introduce the capital to the authentic flavours and textures, which are lovingly prepared at homes, street markets and royal kitchens across India.”</p>
    <p>Our exciting menu introduces diners to progressive takes on traditional dishes such as caramel and banana Paniyaram with Jaggery sauce at breakfast service, Doodh Maach - hake in Bengali sauce - on the A Là Carte menu, Dosas and Khaati egg rolls with a choice of fillings on the lunch menu and Smoked Duck and Mango salads or Kolhapuri Lamb Chops served at dinner.</p>
    <p>Show your Dad a good time on Father’s day, treat him and spend that much needed quality time at Colonel Saab. We've set a new benchmark in London, continuing a strong family tradition of celebrating the vibrant and diverse culture of India’s food and history with humility, elegance and originality.</p>
    <p>Why not make it an extra special occasion for the whole family at Colonel Saab's private dining rooms. These provide a more intimate setting and can accommodate up to 60 people for a reception or 30 for a seated dinner. Guests can also dine in or hire the mezzanine area, a space reminiscent of quarters from a Royal Mahal. For a combination of classic elegance with exotic art, the mezzanine is a perfect place for a Semi-private event within the aura of the main restaurant, which it overlooks, and provides a great area for an intimate gathering of up to 40 people.</p>`,

We do know that February has long been celebrated as a month of romance, and that the history of St. Valentine’s Day contains vestiges of both Christian and ancient Roman tradition... Today, according to the Greeting Card Association, an estimated 145 million Valentine’s Day cards are sent each year, making it the second largest card- sending holiday of the year after Christmas.’ Read more…</p>

            If you haven't heard of Veganuary yet, don’t worry we’re here to
            tell you all about it!
          </p>
          <p>
            A whole month dedicated to healthier eating and doing more for our
            planet. After last year's huge success, we are bringing back our
            Veganuary menu for all of our distinguished customers. Expect to see
            the mouth watering Jack fruit tacos back on the menu, due to popular
            demand, as well as more new dishes created for one month only.
          </p>
          <p>
            As most of you may know Indian cuisine has always been ahead of the
            curve when it comes to veganism. The earliest record of
            vegetarianism dates back to 5th Century BCE India. The ancient
            religion of Jainism promotes a meat-free diet. Jain vegetarianism is
            one of the strictest and most rigorous religiously motivated diets
            on the Indian subcontinent. At Colonel Saab we are strong believers
            in sustainability with our founder Roop Partap Choudhary emphasising
            this through his key practices carried out not just in his London
            restaurant, but also his luxury hotels in India.

            Special Offer; Colonel Saab's traditional lunch tiffin menu
            2-courses. Limited time only.

          <h4 class="text-success">Vegetarian Restaurant Covent Garden</h4>
          <p>
            In India food cooked at home with care and love is considered to
            deliver not only healthy food but also divine contentment. Lunch is
            usually eaten thali-style, with a tantalising selection of regional
            delicacies that may include any combination of spicy vegetables,
            dhal, rice, yoghurt, pickles, bread and pudding served on a big
            steel plate or a banana leaf. The separate compartments in the
            tiffin lunchbox accommodate thali lunches perfectly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tiffin culture is now to be found all over India. Everyone – from
            women in brightly coloured saris working in the fields to giggling
            families on long train journeys – carries a tiffin to provide a
            compact, portable, homemade lunch.
          </p>
          <p>
            Enjoy Colonel Saab’s take on the homemade lunch box consisting of
            dishes such as jaipuri baby aloo, crispy kale & spinach, chicken
            tikka, chickpea chole and pilau rice with an optional sweet course;
            Rose gulab jamun with dry rose petals

            Set in Holborn, this award winning restaurant is only a stone's
            throw away from London’s famous New Year Fireworks display. After
            the past 2 years of cancellations, this time around the displays
            will be highly anticipated. The event is scheduled to take place as
            normal for New Year's Eve 2022. Hear Big Ben's famous "bongs" ring
            out at midnight, followed by the UK's largest annual fireworks event

    content: `<p>Award- winning, luxury Indian restaurant, Colonel Saab will celebrate its first anniversary this October with a twist on an Indian birthday charity tradition, the launch of an exciting new tasting menu, events and special treats for customers.</p>
    <p>The unique dining concept was launched in the heart of London by Roop Partap Choudhary, who meticulously crafted the menu and art-festooned destination as a "love letter” to his family and India. And despite being launched in a period which has been blighted by the pandemic, Brexit and cost of living crisis, it has not only survived, but thrived to be named one of the top Indian restaurants by Forbes, winning Best Restaurant in Feed the Lion awards and welcoming regulars from Nobel Peace Prize winner, Malala Yousafzai - who says "it is the only place which serves the authentic flavours from home” to pop icons, TV stars and presidents.</p>
    <p>To celebrate the modern Indian restaurant at the grand, former Holborn Town Hall will launch an ambitious new Memsaab's Tasting Menu, in honour of Choudhary's mother. The £95 progressive tasting menu will give diners the opportunity to choose a spirit or champagne, with each of the six courses being paired to a surprise cocktail featuring their chosen drink.</p>
    <p>Also to mark its first year, Colonel Saab invites guests to join them in the Indian birthday tradition of wearing new clothes and donating old garments to charity - every diner who brings an old piece of clothing for them to donate to our charity partner Shelter will receive a new, Colonel Saab t-shirt plus 10% discount from the bill, during October. Diners will also receive a complimentary amuse-bouche dessert on 1st and 2nd October.</p>
    <p>Colonel Saab owner, Roop Partap Choudhary says: "I wanted to celebrate the diverse cultures and powerful role food plays in India, by introducing the capital to the authentic flavours and textures that are lovingly prepared at homes, street markets and royal kitchens across India.</p>
    <p>"And I am humbled and thrilled by the reception Colonel Saab has enjoyed from Londoners over the past year and look forward to celebrating our first anniversary with everybody and welcoming in our second year with exciting new menus and plans.”</p>

      We will be serving a special tantalising tasting menu in addition to
      A whole month dedicated to healthier eating and doing more for our
      planet. After last year's huge success, we are bringing back our
      Veganuary menu for all of our distinguished customers. Expect to see

    <p>
      As most of you may know Indian cuisine has always been ahead of the
      curve when it comes to veganism. The earliest record of
      vegetarianism dates back to 5th Century BCE India. The ancient
      religion of Jainism promotes a meat-free diet. Jain vegetarianism is
      one of the strictest and most rigorous religiously motivated diets
      on the Indian subcontinent. At Colonel Saab we are strong believers
      in sustainability with our founder Roop Partap Choudhary emphasising
      this through his key practices carried out not just in his London
      restaurant, but also his luxury hotels in India.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is great to see in the modern day the ideologies behind vegan
      diets coming back into popular culture as we all strive to be the
      best we can be, help others and mother nature.” - Roop Partap
      Choudhary
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Saab’s menu already has a large variety of vegetarian and
      vegan dishes, and now our culinary experts have come up with a whole
      vegan menu with dishes such as Vegan dahi sev puri bed of crisp &
      spiced puff rice and Soya masala curry, chana masala, steam rice,
      roti to name a couple.

            <br />
            Originally established in the bustling streets of Gol Darwaza in the
            Chowk area of Lucknow in 1905, it was here that Haji – Murad Ali,
            more fondly remembered as ‘Tunday Kababi’ sold his delicious kebabs
            for more than a hundred years, and built a legacy to envy.

          <p>
            MUTTON SEEKH KEBAB (LAMB)
            <br />
            Seekh Kebab were originally known as Shish Kebab and was introduced
            to India by the Turks (particularly Turkish traders). In Turkish,
            the word shish actually means a "sword” or skewer and the word kebab
            means "to roast”.

            marinate the meat in forest herbs and cook the kebab on top of a hot
            stone. Typically, in the past meat like rabbit, deer & chicken was
            used.

            fish, shellfish, poultry, meat and even game.
          </p>

            <br />
            Reshmi Kebab is a famous chicken kebab commonly eaten in India and
            Pakistan. It has Mughal influence which can be seen in the process
            of cooking using cream and cashew nuts. Made with boneless chicken,
            it is cooked by marinating chunks of meat in yogurt, cream, cashew
            nut paste, spices and then grilled in a Tandoor. It has a crusty
            upper layer and a soft inside.

            TANDOORI ROASTED TANGRI
            <br />
            Indian cuisine involves grills and Tandoor cooking, especially for
            kebabs, although kebabs are of Persian origin. Tangri Kebab is made
            using chicken legs. Tangri (pronounced as Tangdi) simply means the
            leg or drumstick.
          </p>

            flavours of aromatic masalas. Our chefs pan fry this speciality
            fish, wrap it in banana leaves with all the spices and then roast to
            perfection.

            and cardamom. Dum pukht, which is a cooking technique associated
            with the Northern Indian subcontinent. Meat and vegetables are
            cooked over a low flame, in a dough sealed container with spices.
            Traditions assign its origin in pre-partition India to the reign of
            Nawab Asaf-ud-Daulah (1748–97). The technique is now commonly used
            in other cuisines such as Pakistani and North Indian.
          </p>
          <p>
            KANDHARI PANEER TIKKA
            <br />
            Pomegranate, the key ingredient in this dish, commonly known in
            India as Anardana is used in a lot of North Indian cooking. From
            curries, breads, raitas and tikkas the seeds are used fresh or
            dehydrated. Dehydrated pomegranate seeds lend that required sweet &
            sour flavour in curries or chutneys. It’s the perfect souring agent
            lending that tangy slant to a dish from the Valley Of Uttrakhand.
          </p>
          <p>
            ZIMIKAND KI SHAMI
            <br />
            Originating in the city of Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh once the heart of
            the Mughal command in India. These tasty kebabs are said to have
            been invented by a chef to a great Nawab (ruling nobleman). The
            Nawab, having lost all of his teeth due to his general
            overindulgence, but not wanting to miss out on his chef’s culinary
            delights, challenged the chef to come up with a flavorsome dish that
            could be eaten even by the toothless. And so, as legends tells us,
            the Shami Kebab was born.
          </p>
          <p>
            DAHI KE KEBAB
            <br />

            FALAHARI CHAAT
            <br />
            India is known for its street foods, especially its various kinds of
            chaats. Chaat menus change from region to region – i.e papdi chaat
            in north India and dahi vada in southern India. However, there's a
            kind of chaat which you can find in every region of the country -
            from extreme south to extreme north; and that is fruit chaat. It is
            basically a combination of various fruits mixed together with
            spices. Fruit chaat can any day be considered as a healthier option
            among all the street-foods available across the country, as fruits
            are superfoods, which are considered to be potent sources of
            essential nutrients.
